PROJECT TITLE- SMART CANE

This simple smart glass uses an Arduino and an old cell-phone vibration motor to help detect 
obstacles.

OBJECTIVE:
I wanted to make something to help the visually impaired, so I created an open-source 
Arduino project for a smart glass. This Arduino smart glass can assist with walking alone in 
new environments by taking inputs through an obstacle sensor (ultrasonic sensor) and 
providing feedback to the person through haptics (a vibration motor).
One day while I was out walking, I saw a blind person having a difficult time walking down a 
busy street. I was able to help him, and at that moment that I had an epiphany. I realized that I 
could use technology to assist people like him. It was that evening that I came up with the 
smart glass. I wanted it to be very cheap and easily replicable so even a child can easily make 
it from scratch in a couple of hours.
Using this Arduino smart glass, a visually impaired person can walk without anyone's help. 
The glass can automatically detect an obstacle and give the user a feedback response by 
vibrating the legs of a person.
Two ultrasonic sensors each on one side (right & left) are attached to the spectacles of a blind 
person and this sensor is thereby connected to the Arduino and from Arduino two cell-phone 
vibration motors are attached to each shoe of the blind person through wires.
I used an ultrasonic sensor with an Arduino for detecting the obstacles. It cost me just 
Rs.1200 to make one. It's cheap and easy to make without the need of much soldering.
WorkingThe technology behind the smart glass is pretty straightforward. There are mainly three 
blocks behind it: input, controller, and output. The input consists of an ultrasonic sensor that 
is capable of detecting obstacles at a range of up to about 2 metres. It is interfaced to the 
Arduino, which determines if an obstacle is too close to the spectacles and triggers the output 
if it is. The output consists of a vibration motor to provide haptic response.
When an obstacle comes on the right side of a person at a distance of 2 metres then the right 
leg will vibrate with the help of vibration motors and when an obstacle comes on the left side 
at the same distance then the left leg will vibrate and if an obstacle comes in front (from 
front) then both the legs will vibrate indicating the blind person that there is danger and 
he/she needs to be cautioned.

PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION:
The smart cane available in the market has either buzzing sound or vibration on stick, but
what if the person loses his/her stick somewhere, or 
The smart glasses available in the market till date does not has this feature all-together and 
also the cost efficiency factor comes into play.
